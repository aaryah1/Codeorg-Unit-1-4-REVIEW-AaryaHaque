<h1>Lesson #1 C.F.U </h1>
<p><b>"What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?"</b>
  <br>
To try and connect the daily things you use in your life to the class this will keep you engaged. Try to also take notes on things that are important (the main ideas of the lesson) to keep you productive in class. Try to also be social depending on the teach I find that if I'm friends with my teacher I look forward to the class and stay awake. My strategies are pretty similar to the ones I read before since we have the same problems of getting bored, being stressed out and not being able to keep up. With that the techniques I named were pretty similar in that sense as they really do help with these issues.</p>

  <h1>Lesson #2 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</b></p>
    <br>
  <p>Our question that we were building our device off of had only two options so we only built a sequence of two answers to represent each option. The device was providing us information and the task was to answer the question and so we built our device to do exactly that.</p>
  </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #3 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>It's specifically the decimal system and it starts from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and then afterwards are numbers made up of these 10 digits.</p>
   </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #4 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>They both have the numbers 1 and 0.</p>
   </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #5 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>No because the fraction can't be less than one since the binary system only has 2 places.</p>
   </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #7 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>I would sample the image larger so the pixel sizes can be smaller. The sample size I would use would be 22 x 22 and this would affect the digital representation by making the pixilation widget look more accurate to the picture.</p>
    </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #8 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>The image would be produced by sampling and making the digital representation by seeing how much content could fill the image. I would use RGB pixels to add the color to the image and then use binary to make the content of the image.</p>
  </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #9 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.
    If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>The reason why the file shows 750 bytes instead of 1000b bytes is because of a process called lossless data and the reason not to worry is since it's lossless you aren't losing any of the information and detail. The data is just compressed.</p>
  </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #10 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>Images, videos and text messages are best compressed with lossless compression because you would want to see the full content while music would be used with lossy compression because that's not something to prioritize as much.</p>
   </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #11 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.
  Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>You would need to use a creative commons license because a creative commons license allows others to freely use the art of another's as long as credits are being given to the creator.</p>
</div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #12 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>We should care about information being represented digitally because in today's society technology is very present as well as social media. We are always sharing digital information and image son social media which is how it personally impacts us.</p>
