<h1>Lesson #1 C.F.U </h1>
<p><b>How do you use the Internet?
Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?</b></p>
<br>
<p>I use the internet to do my online schoolwork and to communicate with my friends. It plays a really big role in my life because I am using it everyday. It helps me learn, it helps me accomplish tasks, and it cures my boredom.</p>
    </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #2 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>Three people are in a trio within the group and each cable is connected to each other. From person A to B directly to D. Another path would be A to B to C to D.</p>
  </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #3 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>The internet protocol allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the internet by having a specific IP address which allows a smooth transition of information between different devices with their unique IP addresses. This allows different machines on different networks to communicate.</p>
  </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
  <h1>Lesson #4 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>The benefits of building redundancy into a network is that if the network get's disrupted or something happens to the path where the information would flow through, the redundancy would be backup so even with system failure the information would be able to get passed through. The potential issues for building redundancy is getting confused with the system and there might be a system overload because of tangled and complicated the network become.</p>

  <br>
  <p>Rules for addressing and sending data across the internet by assigning unique numbers to each connected device:Internet Protocol
  Takes inventory of all packets in the datastream to ensure they are successfully sent and received: Transmission Control Protocol
  Chunk of data and its metadata, used to route and reassemble information on the Internet:Packet
  The way in which information travels on the Internet, not as a single piece but in chunks:Datastream 
  The way in which information travels on the Internet, not as a single piece but in chunks:User Datagram Protocol</p>

  <h1>Lesson #6 C.F.U </h1>
  <p><b>Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide 
  Web</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>1. The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using HTTP 
    <br>
    2.HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet</p>
