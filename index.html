    <p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language which is a language used to make web pages.  A tag indicates the start and end of a HTML element and that element’s type. To begin with the coding you would always start with 
      "<!DOCTYPEhtml>". Binary numbers consist of a specific two numbers of 0 and 1. A byte equals 8 bits and 2 nibbles while a bit is the smallest space of memory. Overflow errors are when the amount of data is greater than the amount of storage things. Abstraction is when elements of the code or program are removed that aren’t necessary to the program. Lossy compression is a process for reducing the number of bits needed to represent something in which some information is lost or thrown away, this is an irreversible process. Lossless compression is a process for reducing the number of bits needed to represent something without losing any information, this process is reversible.

    <p>The internet isn’t just made out of thin air, you need specific tools to be able to access the internet or you need specific technology. Here are different aspects of the internet you need to know in order to understand how the internet exactly works. The computing network is the group of devices that data is received and sent on. Behind that is called a computing system where there are devices and programs working together for a common purpose. The network are the actual devices that are included in the system. Just like us the internet had to follow rules, standards, and regulations. This is called protocol. The internet protocol is transferring data across the internet that assigns a unique number to each connected device. This unique number is called an IP address. This IP address is what identifies the device just like your house address because no other house has that address. Before we jump into the data that gets sent and received let’s talk about the bandwidth and how it gets there. The bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. The data then travels through the network within paths and inside packets. Packets are little broken pieces of data that get sent in packages. Since there can be a very large amount of data it can’t all be sent at once so it needs to be broken down into little packets and sent individually so there isn’t a system override. Adding onto the packets are something called packet metadata which is additional data added on to guide them through the network and assemble the original message when it gets to its receiver. Remember how I talked about protocols before? There are different protocols for each part of the internet. For sending the packets of information we have TCP which stands for Transmission Control Protocol which does all error checking to ensure all packets are received and properly ordered. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol which is a protocol that sends the packets quickly and doesn’t worry much about error checking. Now that you know how data is sent, let's talk about how we translate domain names like “example.com” into IP addresses to receive specific data. We use something called DNS which stands for Domain Name System to translate the domain anime into the unique numbers for computing devices (Ip address). There’s a whole system of DNS servers that work together and communicate with one another to translate the domain names into IP addresses. DNS servers are in a distributed hierarchy and DNS associates the website name with the IP address so your computer uses DNS to translate the domain name to an IP address. Since DNS is in a distributed hierarchy this scales out the internet since it’s always expanding. We know that computers communicate but how do they communicate? They communicate using HTTP which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.  This involves what we call a “GET request” which is when the computers request information from another computer. All data gets transferred through the server to the computers which is called the “physical connection.”

    <p>Thinking about when you use an app or website you as the user have to input information. Input is when the computer receives a command or signal from other sources which is something provided to a computer. And it's sort of like a cause and effect where the effect/result is the output. The input is the information received and what goes into the computer however the output is the result which is the visual, auditory and tactile perceptions from the computer after processing the input. The user interface is the visual aspect of the program, (what the user see’s). Sequential programming is determined by the program statements and the program statements only. The program statements that determine the program is the set property. This allows the program to run by itself without the user having to interact with the program. The event driven program is determined by the event driven program statements. The input is the event driven programming statements and the outputs/outcome are the events. Event driven programs also depend on interactivity with the user. Basically “if the user does this…. Do this……” We use program statements to command or instruct the computer to perform this action.

    <p>In an expression the result is the variable value “a + b + c = age.” An assignment operator moves information around and it doesn’t connect variables. Variables can be created, defined and hold value, they are usually created at the top of your program. A variable is the placeholder of a single piece of data, whether it’s a number, words, etc. String is data in coding that is usually used for text like when saying “hello world.” Parameters allow us to put variables or instructions into our code and then use the code to solve multiple problems. Boolean is a variable whose value can be one of two states; TRUE or FALSE. Comparison operators ( <less than, >greater than, == equal too, <=less than or equal to, >=greater than or equal to, != not equal to). Boolean values are a type of information, so they can also be evaluated in a Boolean expression using logical operators. Logical Operators (&& AND ; TRUE && FALSE, || OR, !  NOT). Boolean values are a type of information, so they can also be evaluated in a Boolean expression using logical operators. Using examples like flowcharts to keep information in sequence and make a logical response under restricted conditions. A conditional is an “if then statement”, if this happens then. Function procedure is when the function get’s defined with parameters and variable names.The function can be run multiple times. A function procedure call is when you call the function in the program where you need it, you would just use the name such as “updatescreen();”
